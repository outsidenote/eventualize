# Eventualize

## Understanding Event Sourcing
Event sourcing is an architectural pattern that captures and persists every change as a sequence of events. It provides a historical log of events that can be used to reconstruct the current state of an application at any given point in time. This approach offers various benefits, such as auditability, scalability, and the ability to build complex workflows.

Event sourcing, when combined with the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern, offers even more advantages. CQRS separates the read and write concerns of an application, enabling the generation of dedicated databases optimized for specific read or write needs. This separation of concerns allows for more agile and flexible database schema designs, as they are less critical to set up in advance.
