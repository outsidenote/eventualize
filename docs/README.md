EvDb is an opinionated event-sourcing framework that unlocks the untapped potential of transactional data while eliminating many challenges related to management of transactional data and its schema.
EvDb is quick & easy to integrate, and while it is working with new paradigms and patterns under the hood, it abstracts most of it away and does not distrupt development.
